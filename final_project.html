  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Climate Change</h3>
  <p>It's no secret that climate change is impacting our planet at a devastating rate each day. For many of us in college in
  America, however, climate change can feel like a distant topic. Certainly scary and pressing, but there aren't any ice caps on our
  backyard that we can see melting. <br> However, climate change affects everyone. Even if you haven't had your home washed away from the rising tides, you may
  have felt ecoanxiety (anxiety over the future state of the planet) or seen campaigns to decrease energy usage on campus. <br> Climate change even affects our libraries!
  Through global warming's effect on mental health, social inequality, and urban climate action, libraries have the potential to revolutionize their image from obsolete book loaners to community recreational centers.

    <span class="border" style="background-color:transparent;font-size:25px;color: #f7f7f7;">WHY LIBRARIES?</span>
  </div>
</div>

<div style="color: #777;background-color:white;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
  <p>But first, why libraries? <br> Libraries have always been an integral part of my life. The calm environment and limitless amounts of information were reassuring when I had a bad day,
    and the power of a library card felt too good to be true, all at the cost of 0 dollars. I was fortunate enough to grow up with public libraries where heating
    and air conditioning were guaranteed, as well as a clean environment and vigilant librarians. Even as I grew older, I still frequented the local library, using both its test prep books and studying corner to eventually get into college. 
    <br> It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say my life has been shaped by the services public libraries provide. However, many dispute the future of public libraries 
    with the rising popularity of Kindles and iPads. I'd argue that libraries are constantly making changes to remain relevant. From e-book loaning systems to electronic borrowing systems, libraries prove they can adapt to technology quickly. 
    Surely, they can do the same with climate change.

  <p>As mentioned before, one of the ways climate change directly affects everyone is mental health. While it is not an
  obvious result of climate change, studies
  have shown mental health is impacted by global warming and natural disasters that may be exacerbated by climate change.
  The Lancet 2015 report described mental health as ‘the most dangerous indirect impact of global warming’. Luckily, there are methods we can use to mitigate these negative effects. The American Public Health Association
  suggests three methods to build empowerment
  and mental resilience towards climate change. These are:
  <li>readiness (getting educated on what climate events entail and how to prepare for them)</li>
  <li>monitoring (knowing your physical and mental health and seeking help if necessary)</li>
  <li>cooperation (establishing social ties and connections with the community)</li>
  Libraries are excellent sources to practice these, especially readiness and cooperation. In California, the Santa Monica Public Library began offering a Green Prize
  for Sustainable Literature to authors who broaden public awareness of sustainability. In Massachusetts, the Boston Public Library plans multiple programs for the state's Climate
  Preparedness Week and Memorial Hall Library held a program on climate change that covered everything from the latest
  academic news to specific actions citizens can take to increase their personal sustainability. <br> In ways like this, many public libraries help citizens not only demystify
  climate change but also learn ways to mitigate
  it in their own houses.
  These programs inherently involve interacting with the community, offering a means of cooperation. By strengthening
  social ties with these programs, libraries
  also ensure that citizens' mental state is benefiting from the knowledge that they are not alone in combating climate
  change. Even in their local community,
  these citizens can find a support system. While this process would consume human capital (the presenters, program
  directors, and other experts), it would also enhance
  human capital (the citizens learning and benefiting from these programs).

  <div style="color:#ddd;background-color:#282E34;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
  <p>Social inequality is another way climate change affects libraries. As socioeconomic status as well as gender and race
  all interplay into where an individual may live, there are groups that are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
  For instance, as the global temperature increases, this only exacerbates the heat conditions that cities often find themselves in. Due
  to the close placement of buildings and dark asphalt roads combined with lack of greenery, cities retain heat much longer and more intensely than open rural areas. Unfortunately, when this combines with low
  socioeconomic status and rising temperatures, the usual danger of heat stroke and dehydration can become fatal.
  <br>When explaining why libraries are important to me, I mentioned the consistency of the library's
  temperature. In the summer, there was always A/C and in the winter,
  there was always heating. It was so consistent to the point that sometimes my mother would take us to the library to
  save a little money on utilities. I can imagine
  that many families in lower socioeconomic households would do the same, but do their libraries even provide these utilities?
  <br> After watching the lecture videos on urban climate action,
  I think libraries are in a position to combat both climate change and social inequality. If libraries were constructed in low
  socioeconomic neighborhoods with passive design, the locals
  could save much-needed money on bills while the state could decrease their energy consumption. While this would require human
  capital and financial capital as these neighborhoods
  don't have the financial means to construct these libraries themselves, this cost can be mitigated with organizations
  such as Details Deconstruction that give disadvantaged workers a second chance, further helping us towards the goal of social equality.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, while many dispute the viability of public libraries in the future, I believe that libraries are here to
    stay. If anything, I believe the climate
    change movement is an opportunity for the public library to show its true potential as a community pillar.</p>
